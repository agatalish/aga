<h5>Inflation is defined as a rise in the prices of goods in a country that reduces the purchasing power of its citizens. Inflation is not altogether absent from any economy. It keeps on fluctuating. It remains normal as long as it does not surpass its threshold for a year.

In order to avoid inflation or to balance it, a state tries to create a balance between the goods and services produced and their demand. In Pakistan, excessive domestic demand outweighs the supply of services and goods available.</h5>
